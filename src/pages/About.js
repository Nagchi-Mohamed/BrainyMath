        <SectionTitle>Our Story</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          BrainyMath was born out of a simple observation: traditional mathematics education often fails to engage students and doesn't adapt to individual learning needs. Our founder, Sarah Johnson, a former math teacher, experienced this challenge firsthand in her classroom.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          In 2020, Sarah teamed up with Michael Chen, a software engineer with a passion for educational technology, to create a platform that would make mathematics learning more interactive and personalized. What started as a small project has grown into a comprehensive learning platform used by thousands of students worldwide.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Today, BrainyMath continues to evolve, incorporating feedback from our users and the latest research in mathematics education to provide an ever-improving learning experience.
